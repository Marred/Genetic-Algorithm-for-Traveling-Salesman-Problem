This project is my implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving a traveling salesman problem. 
I've implemented randomizing instances, tournament and roulette selection PMX crossover and inversion mutation.
It is a project for university classes, it was only meant to do it's job(which it does), so some good practices and rules might've been violated.
